# Uber-Eats-Delivery-Prediction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict food delivery times for Uber Eats. Accurate delivery-time predictions are essential for improving customer satisfaction, optimising routing, and supporting courier management. Using historical delivery data, the model applies Linear Regression with Gradient Descent to estimate total delivery time (in minutes) based on a range of order, courier, and environmental factors.
